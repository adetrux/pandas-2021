# Business intelligence laboratory - Pandas lab starter code

This repository contains two notebooks:

1. Introduction to Pandas, also available [here](https://github.com/bi-labor/pandas-2021/blob/main/Pandas_introduction.ipynb)
2. The lab starter code. This is the one you need to fill out and submit.

## Installation

The [Anaconda Python distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) contains all necessary packages but you can also install the packages one-by-one.

You can optionally install the [extension library](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for Jupyter and enable the Table of Contents (main/toc2) extension.

## Submission

Submissions must be made through Github Classroom. The invitation link is available in Moodle.
